Practical Kubernetes - Beyond CKA and CKAD | Hands-on

# What's in this course?

Practical Kubernetes - Beyond CKA and CKAD | Hands-on is a comprehensive course designed to take you from foundational Kubernetes concepts to advanced, production-level skills, with a focus on practical applications and real-world scenarios. 

The course starts with foundational topics, perfect for beginners, covering core Kubernetes principles, container orchestration, architecture, and installation. As you progress, you'll dive into intermediate topics like Kubernetes objects, networking, and manifest file creation, setting the stage for more complex scenarios. 

In the advanced sections, you'll learn how to manage Kubernetes in production, covering tasks like rollouts/rollbacks, cluster maintenance, security using RBAC, and advanced pod configurations. You'll also explore specialized topics like monitoring, network policies, Ingress, private registries, and Helm charts for efficient application management. 

By the end of the course, you'll be well-prepared for both CKA and CKAD certifications, and more importantly, equipped with hands-on expertise to manage, deploy, and troubleshoot Kubernetes clusters in real-world environments.

Special Note: 

This course is designed to showcase all practical concepts with live demonstrations. Every concept is presented in real-time, and any errors that arise are troubleshooted and addressed as they occur live in the demonstrations.
